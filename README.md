# HLSL-Spherical-Harmonics

## Description

A collection of HLSL functions one can include to use spherical harmonics in shaders.
This is very practical when generating and consuming SH on the GPU. 
This repository can be simply be used as a submodule.

As of today, only 2nd order spherical harmonics functions are provided.

Do not hesitate to send suggestions or improvements.
